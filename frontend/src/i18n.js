        <b>GBM vs. GARCH Models</b><br/><br/>
        The chart above compares stock price simulations using two models:<br/><br/>
        <ul>
          <li><b>GBM (Geometric Brownian Motion):</b> Assumes constant volatility and normally distributed returns. Commonly used in financial modeling for its simplicity.</li>
          <li><b>GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity):</b> Accounts for changing (time-varying) volatility over time, making it more suitable for modeling real-world market behavior and shocks.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        Use this comparison to evaluate how volatility assumptions affect projected price paths over time.

        <b>GBM vs. GARCH Models</b><br/><br/>
        The chart above compares stock price simulations using two models:<br/><br/>
        <ul>
          <li><b>GBM (Geometric Brownian Motion):</b> Assumes constant volatility and normally distributed returns. Commonly used in financial modeling for its simplicity.</li>
          <li><b>GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity):</b> Accounts for changing (time-varying) volatility over time, making it more suitable for modeling real-world market behavior and shocks.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        Use this comparison to evaluate how volatility assumptions affect projected price paths over time.
