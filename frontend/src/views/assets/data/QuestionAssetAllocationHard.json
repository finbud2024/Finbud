        "Question": "What is the impact of interest rates on bond prices?",
        "Answers": [
            {"Answer": "As interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and vice versa.", "Correct": true, "Explanation": "When interest rates increase, the prices of existing bonds typically decrease because new bonds are issued with higher yields, making existing bonds less attractive."},
            {"Answer": "Bond prices are inversely related to interest rates, not directly.", "Correct": false, "Explanation": "Bond prices have an inverse relationship with interest rates; they do not move directly with interest rates."},
            {"Answer": "Interest rates impact bond prices inversely; as rates rise, bond prices fall.", "Correct": false, "Explanation": "Although this statement is true, the question's correct answer must be a complete explanation of the relationship."},
            {"Answer": "Interest rates and bond prices have a direct relationship, not inverse.", "Correct": false, "Explanation": "Interest rates and bond prices have an inverse relationship, meaning they move in opposite directions."}
